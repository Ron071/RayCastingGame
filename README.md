Project Title: Raycasting Maze Game

Description:
A real-time 3D maze game implemented in C++ using SFML. Features multithreaded raycasting for fast rendering, dynamic maze generation, and smooth player movement.

Key Features:
Procedural maze generation with algorithmic path carving.
Raycasting engine with multithreading using POSIX threads for optimized rendering.
Thread-safe rendering with mutexes to prevent race conditions.
Real-time player controls, collision detection, and goal detection.
Timer and score system displayed on-screen.

Technologies & Concepts:
C++23 and SFML for graphics and window management.
Multithreading & Mutexes for parallel raycasting.
Data structures & algorithms for maze generation and raycasting.
Object-oriented design for clean separation of Player, Maze, Rays, and Game logic.
